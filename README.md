# Z/OSMF Auth Plugin
This is a plugin for using z/osmf as an authentication & authorization endpoint.
Auth plugins can be associated with non-auth plugins such that dataservices will not be processed without first passing authentication and authorization checks for the auth plugins associated with them.
In the case of this plugin, you can use this plugin to secure services that may be used to do REST calls to a z/osmf installation.

Because this plugin uses z/osmf sessions to confirm authentication, this plugin must be configured to know which z/osmf installation to target.

Before use, edit the file `proxy/remote.json` by setting the host and port that points to a running z/osmf instance.
Afterwards, be sure to run a Zowe deploy process by moving to `/zlux-build` and running `ant deploy`.
